**Go here instead now**: https://github.com/naev/naev/tree/main/utils/lanes-generator

Temporary(ish): Python code to explore "safe lane" generation for Naev. Started by @nenau-again.

Usage: Clone this alongside your `naev` clone (so that `naev` and `naev-lane-generator` are sibling directories), `cd naev-lane-generator`, `./lanes_generator.py`.
